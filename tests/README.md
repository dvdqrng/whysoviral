# Testing TikTok Account Functionality

This directory contains tests for the TikTok account management functionality in the application.

## Issue Fixed

We fixed an issue where the application was failing to add new TikTok accounts due to improper handling of User IDs (UIDs) when making API calls. The following issues have been addressed:

1. Improved validation of TikTok User IDs before making API calls
2. Better error handling when usernames can't be resolved to User IDs
3. Ensured the User ID from the API response is used instead of the input ID
4. Added proper input cleaning and validation

## How to Test

### Automated Tests

To run the automated tests (requires jest installation):

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest jest-environment-jsdom ts-jest node-fetch --legacy-peer-deps
npm test
```

### Manual Testing

If you don't want to set up Jest, here are steps for manual testing:

1. **Test with a valid TikTok username (e.g., @username)**
   - Go to the Add Profile tab and enter @username
   - Verify account is added successfully and appears in the profiles list

2. **Test with a TikTok profile URL (e.g., https://tiktok.com/@username)**
   - Go to the Add Profile tab and enter the URL
   - Verify account is added successfully

3. **Test with a valid TikTok User ID (e.g., 7074943646416585986)**
   - Go to the Add Profile tab and enter the numeric ID
   - Verify account is added successfully

4. **Check error handling with invalid inputs**
   - Try random text or malformed URLs
   - Verify appropriate error messages are shown

5. **Monitor server logs to verify:**
   - User ID extraction is working correctly
   - API calls to TikTok are formatted properly
   - Response data is correctly processed

## What We Fixed

The main changes to fix the TikTok account addition issue were:

1. In `app/api/tiktok/user/route.ts`:
   - Added better error handling for username resolution
   - Ensured we're using the correct user ID from the API response
   - Added more validation for the user ID

2. In `lib/tiktok-scraper-service.ts`:
   - Improved the `getUserInfo` function to validate user IDs
   - Added better error handling for invalid IDs
   - Added validation to ensure the returned user ID matches what we requested

These changes ensure that we're properly sending and receiving the UID (User ID) to and from the TikTok API, which was the root cause of the account addition failures.
